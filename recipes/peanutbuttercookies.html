    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>These peanut butter cookies saved my life in Chicago's O-Block in '98. The opps had decided to run a fade on my location and were strapped to the teeth with a wide assortment of blickies, gats, glizzies, and more. The peanut butter cookies were able to effectively provide 360 degree overwatch from a neighboring building with their illicitly-acquired AK-74M, providing me with the perfect window to escape the South Side Crips. I owe these peanut butter cookies my life.</p>
