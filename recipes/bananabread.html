    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>This banana bread saved my life during the Spring Offensive in Iraq in '04. The rest of my platoon had been laid out by local militiamen. One of the enemy, a huge guy, spotted me taking cover in a ditch. I tried firing my 1911 only to realize I had mistakenly brought my airsoft replica. I thought it was all over. This banana bread ran through 500 yards of enemy fire to viciously disembowel my assailant with nothing but an MRE spoon. The amount of blood was unimaginable. I've never seen anything like it.</p>
